# firefly-python-api

Python client library for the Firefly III REST API — shared HTTP layer with credential management and API coverage for accounts, transactions, and reporting resources.

## Spec-Driven Development

All changes must be grounded in a requirements specification at `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`.

Before writing any code for a new feature or change:

1. Update `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` with the relevant requirement(s) and use case(s).
2. Present the updated text and ask the user: "Is this what you intended?"
3. Wait for explicit confirmation.
4. Only then follow the TDD cycle.

If a change cannot be expressed as a requirement and use case, do not implement it.

## Task Management

Tasks live in `docs/tasks/TASK-XXX-short-description.md`. See the Workflow Guardian
agent (`.github/agents/workflow-guardian.agent.md`) for the task file format and full
workflow enforcement.

**Branch policy:** Every task runs on its own `task/<NNN>-short-description` branch.
Never commit implementation work on `main`.

**Branch sync:** After switching to the task branch, check if it is behind `main`.
If it is, run `git merge main` before writing any code.

**Task workflow:**

```bash
make branch-task f=TASK-001        # create/switch to task branch
# implement, then update CHANGELOG.md and task file Completion section
make stage-current-task            # auto-fix and stage files listed in task file
git diff --staged                  # optional review
make commit-current-task           # commit using message from task file — never git commit directly
make pr-current-task               # open GitHub PR
make merge-current-task            # squash-merge when ready, pull main
```

Or with explicit task ID: `make stage-task f=TASK-001`, `make commit-task`, `make pr-task`.

## Bug Discovery

Use the **Bug Triage** agent (`.github/agents/bug-triage.agent.md`) to hunt for
bugs without fixing anything. It analyses code against the requirements spec,
produces a prioritised list, and creates task files for approved bugs.

## TDD

**Red → Green → Refactor.** No exceptions.

- Use **Hypothesis** for all parsing and data transformation functions.
- Coverage must not drop below the task-start baseline when a task is completed.

## Running the Application

```bash
make help
```

## Changelog

Describe shipped behavior, not internal task bookkeeping.

- Behavior-first language: what was added, changed, or fixed.
- TASK-ID as a suffix reference only.
- Do not write an entry that only says a task was completed.
- Group related work into one bullet rather than one bullet per sub-task.

## What NOT to Do

- Do not write code before the requirements spec is confirmed.
- Do not skip writing tests first (TDD).
- Do not commit code that fails `make lint` or `make test`.
- Do not add dependencies without a clear requirement.
- Do not suppress type errors with `# type: ignore` without explanation.
- Do not run `git commit` directly on a task branch — always use `make commit-current-task`.
